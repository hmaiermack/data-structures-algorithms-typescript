## Complexity Analysis

- Complexity Analysis

  The process of determining how efficient an algorithm is. Complexity analysis usually involves finding both the time and space complexity of an algorithm.  
   Effectively: how good is your algorithm.

- Time Complexity

  A measure of how fast a program runs, measured using Big O notation.

- Space Complexity

  A measure of how much auxillary memory an algorithm takes, expressed in Big O notation

Performing any action on a set of data is going to take both time and memory. The relationships between the data will also have ramifications on the space and time complexity
