# Big O Notation

## Big O

Notation used to describe time and space complexity. Variables used within big O denote the sizes of inputs into an algorithm.
For example, O(n) might be the time complexity of an algorithm that traverses an array of length n; O(n+m) might be the time complexity
of an algorithm that traverses an array of length n and a string of length m.

## Common notation - Fastest to Slowest

- Constant Time - O(1)
- Logarithmic Time - O(log(n))
- Linear Time - O(n)
- Log-Linear Time - O(n log(n))
- Quadratic Time - O(n^2)
- Cubic Time - O(n^3)
- Exponential Time - O(2^n)
- Factorial Time - O(n!)

In coding interviews, Big O notation is usually understood to describe the worst case scenario of an algorithm, rather than the best or average case.

- It can be useful to specify how the algorithm performs in each case.
